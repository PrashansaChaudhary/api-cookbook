**Perplexity FinCaseAI** is a lightweight, AI-powered tool that reviews credit card dispute complaints and assists analysts by suggesting decisions based on fraud patterns, urgency, and reasoning.

## Features

- Approve/Reject decision suggestions with confidence levels  
- Fraud risk scoring using keyword and pattern matching  
- Sentiment and urgency detection from complaint text  
- Sonar API integration for final recommendations and reasoning  
- Optional Redis-based caching for performance  

## How It Uses Sonar

FinCaseAI sends case descriptions as structured prompts to the **Sonar API**, asking for:

- A decision recommendation (approve/reject)  
- A brief explanation for the judgment  

The API response is parsed and shown alongside internal fraud and sentiment scores for a complete picture.

> **Example Prompt to Sonar**  
> "_Given the following customer complaint, should the dispute be approved or rejected? Provide a short explanation._"
